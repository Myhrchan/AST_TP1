## Introduction
This website is a basic javascript site working with Node.js, which say 'hello' when you enter your name in the url.
I have incorporated the module expressJs in order to create an API.

## Installation
Run the `index.js` script on node.js (with the instruction `node index.js`), then connect to you localhost on port 8080 : `http://localhost:8080/`

## Usage
You can type `/explains` in the url to have all explanations on how to interact with this site.

Type `/hello` to print Hello on the page, and `/hello/yourname` so that the website tells you hello.

To see a short description of myself, type the url `/hello/mariane`
